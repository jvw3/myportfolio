          I'm a self-motivated, team oriented, algorithmic thinker with a
          passion for learning, and a strength for working in a high pressure,
          fast-paced, environment. I've recently made the transition to software
          development after playing professional football for the last seven
          years. I'm accustomed to comprehending a variety of new concepts in a
          short period of time and seeking a position to expand and leverage my
          strengths.
